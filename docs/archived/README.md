# Archived Documentation

All documents in this directory are **historical snapshots** captured during various phases of development. They preserve the planning, analysis, and decision-making context from their original time of writing.

## Important

Status claims, TODO lists, and "planned" labels in these documents **may not reflect current implementation state**. Many features described as planned or missing have since been implemented.

For the authoritative mapping of specifications to implementation status, see:

- **[`docs/FEATURE-AUDIT.md`](../FEATURE-AUDIT.md)** — Comprehensive spec-to-code audit trail
- **[`MANIFEST.md`](../../MANIFEST.md)** — Complete file catalog
- **[`CONSOLIDATED-SPECIFICATIONS.md`](../../CONSOLIDATED-SPECIFICATIONS.md)** — Current technical specifications

Files with known documentation drift carry a `⚠️ ARCHIVED — HISTORICAL SNAPSHOT` banner at the top.
