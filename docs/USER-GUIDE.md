## Getting Started

### Your First Steps

When you sign up for in–midst–my–life, you'll go through a 7-step onboarding wizard that introduces core concepts:

1. **Welcome** - Understand what the system does
2. **Master Profile** - Learn what to include
3. **Personas** - Define your authentic masks
4. **Hunter Protocol** - Discover automated job search
5. **Inverted Interview** - Evaluate employers
6. **Feedback** - Shape the product
7. **Complete** - Start exploring features

**You can skip the tour anytime**, but we recommend completing it once to understand the philosophy.

### Key Concepts

Before diving in, understand three fundamental ideas:

#### 🎭 Theatrical Identity

You're not one person. You're a complete human with many authentic facets:
- A professional who codes
- A parent who manages household operations
- An artist who creates
- A teacher who mentors others
- A person in recovery who learned resilience
- A writer who communicates ideas

A traditional resume asks: "Pick one."

In–midst–my–life asks: "How do you show up differently in different contexts, and which version matters for this situation?"

**Personas are not deceptions.** They're honest filtered views of yourself.

#### 📊 Curriculum Vitae Multiplex

Your **master CV** is a single source of truth containing everything you've accomplished. Each entry is tagged with:

- **Personae** (which masks benefit from seeing it)
- **Aetas** (which life-stage it occurred in)
- **Scaenae** (which stage/context it applies to)

From this one master document, we generate:
- Context-specific **resumés** (filtered views)
- **Cover letters** (persona-aligned narratives)
- **Interview prep** (relevant talking points)
- **Analytics** (skill mapping and growth)

#### ⚡ Autonomous Agents

Rather than manually applying to hundreds of jobs (as traditional job hunting requires), you define criteria once, and our autonomous agents:

1. **Search** job boards matching your criteria
2. **Analyze** skill gaps honestly
3. **Tailor** your resume to highlight relevant persona
4. **Write** personalized cover letters
5. **Apply** (with your review and approval)

**Pro Tip:** Include everything that represents real capability. The system will help you decide which persona wants to highlight what.

### Step 2: Tag Your Experience

As you add experiences, tag them:

**Persona Tags:** Which of your personas benefit from this experience?
- If you taught a programming course, tag it "Engineer," "Technician," "Teacher," "Creator"

**Aetas Tags:** Which life-stage was this?
- Early Career, Growth Phase, Leadership, Transition, Recovery, Creative

**Scaenae Tags:** What context does it apply to?
- Corporate, Startup, Education, Non-profit, Community, Open Source

**Visibility:** Who should see this?
- Public (everyone)
- Employer-specific (only shown to organizations you're considering)
- Persona-specific (only shown when persona is active)

---

## Creating Personas

### What is a Persona?

A persona is an authentic subset of yourself, emphasized for a specific context.

**It's not:**
- A lie or deception
- A mask hiding the real you

- **Shows up in:** Data scientist, researcher, business analyst, UX researcher
- **Typical profile:** Research publications, data projects, insights driven

### Create Custom Personas

You can also define your own personas:

1. **Give it a name** that feels authentic (e.g., "The Resilient Rebuilder")
2. **Write a brief description** (2-3 sentences about how this persona shows up)
3. **Assign a tone** (how does this persona communicate? Formal? Casual? Creative?)
4. **Define core values** (what matters most to this persona?)
5. **Set visibility** (who sees this persona? Everyone? Specific employers?)
6. **Add a motto** (optional Latin epigraph or personal motto)

**Example:**
```
Name: The Rebuilder
Description: Someone who has walked through fire and come out stronger. 
  Understands resilience, empathy, and the power of second chances.
Tone: Honest, vulnerable, grounded
Core Values: Authenticity, growth, paying it forward, human connection
Visibility: Everyone who asks
Motto: "From ash, growth"
```

---

## Understanding Your Master CV

### How Filtering Works

Imagine your master CV contains 100 experiences tagged across 3 dimensions:

```
Experience: Managed household of 4 people on $50k/year budget
Personae: [Mother, Creator, Analyst]
Aetas: [Early Career, Household Management]
Scaenae: [Personal, Community]

↓ When Engineer persona is selected ↓

This entry doesn't appear because Engineer isn't in [Mother, Creator, Analyst]

BUT the Finance & Operations skills are tagged as relevant to Engineer,
so the skill summary appears in the Engineer resume.
```

### Generating Your Resumés

For each persona, the system generates a **unique, honest resumé**:

1. **Filter experiences** by persona tag
2. **Re-order by relevance** to the target role
3. **Rewrite bullets** to emphasize relevant achievements
4. **Add context** about how this persona evolved
5. **Export** as PDF, Markdown, or JSON-LD

**Example for "Engineer" persona applying to "Senior Backend Engineer" role:**

```
JOHN SMITH
Senior Software Engineer | System Designer | Mentor

CORE SKILLS
- 8 years backend engineering (TypeScript, Go, PostgreSQL)
- System architecture and scaling (served 50M+ requests/day)
- Team leadership (managed 4 engineers)

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Principal Engineer, TechCorp (2021-present)
- Designed microservices migration (reduced response time 65%)
- Led incident response for critical systems
- Mentored 4 junior engineers through career transitions

Senior Software Engineer, StartupXYZ (2019-2021)
- Built payment processing system from scratch
- Implemented automated testing (coverage 85%)
- Established on-call rotation and runbook system

(Note: Household, Creative, and Teaching work NOT shown in Engineer resumé
unless explicitly tagged as Engineer-relevant)
```

### What Gets Filtered Out?

When the "Engineer" persona is active:

- Creative writing portfolio ❌ (unless tagged as Engineer-relevant)
- Household management ❌ (unless tagged as Engineer-relevant)
- Teaching experience ❌ (unless tagged as Engineer-relevant)

**This isn't hiding the truth.** It's presenting the relevant truth for this context.

## Using the Hunter Protocol

### What is the Hunter Protocol?

The Hunter Protocol is a four-step autonomous job search system:

1. **Search** - Find relevant jobs
2. **Analyze** - Assess your fit honestly
3. **Tailor** - Present relevant persona
4. **Apply** - Send with personalized cover letter

Rather than sending 2000 applications to generic roles, you'll send 10-20 applications to carefully evaluated matches.

### Setting Up Your Hunter Profile

#### Define Your Criteria

**What are you looking for?**
- Job titles or keywords
- Company characteristics (size, funding, industry)
- Location/remote requirements
- Compensation range
- Company values alignment

**Example:**
```
Job Search Criteria:
- Titles: "Senior Software Engineer", "Technical Lead", "Architect"
- Keywords: TypeScript, React, microservices, high-scale
- Remote: Fully remote or hybrid in San Francisco
- Company Stage: Series B-D funded startups
- Salary: $180-250k + equity
- Values: Diversity, ethical AI, sustainable business practices
```

#### Set Your Personas

Which persona(s) should be presented for each search? You can create job-specific persona combinations:

```
Backend Engineering Role → Engineer Persona
  (Show: Technical depth, system design, mentoring)
  
Startup CTO Role → Architect + Engineer + Connector
  (Show: Strategy, implementation, fundraising ability)
```

#### Define Your Evaluation Criteria

When the Hunter finds a job, it will analyze:

1. **Skill Match** - Do you have required skills?
2. **Growth Fit** - Will you grow in this role?
3. **Values Alignment** - Do your values match?
4. **Compensation** - Is it in your range?
5. **Sustainability** - Is the company healthy?

You'll receive an **Honest Assessment Report** for each job:

```
Job: Senior Engineer at FutureAI
Match Score: 78/100

✓ MATCH (75% of required skills)
- 8 years backend engineering
- TypeScript, PostgreSQL experience
- System design expertise

△ GROWTH (80% fit)
- Limited ML/AI experience (they need this)
- Will require 3-6 month ramp-up
- Strong mentors available

✗ CONCERN (60% values fit)
- Company's ethical AI practices unclear
- Limited diversity in engineering team
- No public sustainability commitment

$ COMPENSATION
- Posted: $200k + equity
- Your target: $180-250k ✓
- Equity package: 0.1% (typical for Series C)
```

### The Application Process

#### Step 1: System Tailors Your Resume

The Hunter analyzes the job description and selects which persona resonates best:

```
Job Description Analysis:
- "Need someone to lead technical strategy" → Architect persona
- "Build scalable systems" → Engineer persona  
- "Mentor junior team members" → Teacher persona

Recommended Persona: Architect + Engineer (70% architect, 30% engineer)

Generated Resume shows:
- Your strategic vision work (90% Architect work)
- Your implementation track record (optional Engineer highlights)
- Your team impact (teaching/mentoring angle)
- HIDES: Creative work, household management (not relevant)
```

#### Step 2: AI Generates Cover Letter

The cover letter is **personalized but honest**:

```
[Generated Cover Letter]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Principal Architect role at FutureAI.

For 8 years, I've designed systems that scale. My work at TechCorp took a 
monolithic platform serving 100k users to a microservices architecture 
supporting 50M+ daily requests. But beyond infrastructure, I've learned that 
great architecture is fundamentally about enabling human problem-solving.

At StartupXYZ, I led our CTO through a strategic pivot that required not just 
system redesign, but organizational thinking. We shifted from optimizing 
revenue per user to optimizing for sustainable growth. That taught me that 
architecture decisions are business decisions.

Your posting emphasizes building "ethical, responsible AI systems." That 
resonates deeply with me. [Personalized paragraph about their values]

I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of [...specific thing from job post...]

I'd love to discuss how my experience in [...relevant domain...] can help you 
[...their goal...].

Sincerely,
John Smith
```

#### Step 3: You Review & Approve

Before applying, you see:

- Your persona-filtered resume
- Generated cover letter
- Honest assessment report
- Timeline for the application

You can:
- ✅ Approve and apply
- ✏️ Edit the cover letter

#### Step 4: Batch Apply

Once approved, applications go out with:
- Your persona-filtered resume
- Personalized cover letter
- Link to your public profile

## Inverted Interviews

### The Traditional Interview Problem

Traditional interviews:
- ❌ Employer controls the questions
- ❌ Candidate hopes to impress
- ❌ Information is asymmetric
- ❌ Red flags only emerge after you're hired
- ❌ Power dynamic favors the employer

### The Inverted Interview Solution

In–midst–my–life **flips the dynamic**:

When an employer visits your profile to review you, they're automatically presented with **YOUR questions about THEM**.

### The Five Evaluation Categories

Employers answer questions across five dimensions:

#### 1. Cultural Fit (You evaluate them)

Your questions:
- What does a typical day look like? (honesty check)
- How are conflicts handled? (management style)
- What's your turnover rate? Why do people leave? (health indicator)
- How diverse is your team? What's your track record? (values alignment)
- What's the communication style? (async, sync, open, structured?)

**Their answers reveal:**
- Whether they're honest about challenges
- How much turnover they're hiding
- Whether diversity is tokenism or genuine
- Management quality
- Alignment with your working style

#### 2. Growth Potential (What will you learn?)

Your questions:
- What skills will I develop? (specific examples)
- Who are my mentors? How available are they?
- What's your track record with career progression? (promotions, laterals)
- Do you invest in training/conferences/development?
- How much autonomy do I have to shape my role?

**Their answers reveal:**
- Whether they invest in people
- If mentorship is real or theoretical
- Growth ceiling (how far can you go?)
- Learning culture

#### 3. Compensation & Benefits

Your questions:
- Full compensation transparency (base, bonus, equity structure)
- What's your equity timeline? (vesting, refresh grants?)
- Health insurance and benefits details
- Work-life balance expectations (hours, on-call, travel?)
- Remote work policy and culture

**Their answers reveal:**
- Whether they're transparent
- If comp is competitive or they're undercut
- Hidden expectations (crunch culture?)
- How much they value work-life balance

#### 4. Sustainability (Will they survive?)

Your questions:
- Business health (runway, profitability, growth trajectory)
- What's your capital strategy? (next funding, path to profitability?)
- How's your customer retention? (sign of product quality)
- How stable is your market?
- What are your biggest risks?

**Their answers reveal:**
- Job security likelihood
- Whether they're honest about challenges
- Whether you'll have stability to do good work

#### 5. Impact & Purpose (Does it align?)

Your questions:
- What impact are you trying to have?
- Who does your product serve? Who doesn't?
- How do you handle ethical trade-offs?
- What's your environmental/social impact?
- How do you measure success beyond revenue?

**Their answers reveal:**
- Whether impact is real or marketing
- Ethical alignment
- Whether this is a job or a mission

### How It Works

1. **You set up your profile** with your evaluation criteria
2. **Employer visits your profile** to view your background
3. **They see your evaluation form** with your 5-category questions
4. **They must answer** to see your full profile
5. **You review their answers** before scheduling interviews
6. **Both parties know where they stand** before meeting

### The Mutual Benefit

**For You:**
- Red flags emerge before you invest time
- You maintain power in the process
- You interview people who respect you
- You find culture fits, not just job fits

**For Employers:**
- They attract candidates who are serious and thoughtful
- They demonstrate confidence in their company
- They signal to candidates they have nothing to hide
- They pre-filter for candidates aligned with their values

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this a lie? Am I being deceptive?**

A: No. You're being contextual. Everyone does this naturally:
- You speak differently to your boss than to your kids
- You emphasize different skills to different people
- You're authentic in all contexts, just with different emphasis

In–midst–my–life makes this explicit and honest instead of implicit and hidden.

**Q: What if employers figure out I have multiple personas?**

A: You can tell them. Many will appreciate the honesty and self-awareness. And yes, your personas are linked—they can see that "Engineer John" and "Architect John" are the same person if you want them to.

The question isn't "do you have personas?" Everyone does. The question is "are you honest about them?"

**Q: How much should I include? Isn't this overwhelming?**

A: Include everything that represents real capability. The system filters it. Your resume won't be 5 pages—it'll be 1-2 pages tailored to each role, because we only show relevant experience.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How secure is my data?**

A: 
- All data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- HTTPS in transit (TLS 1.3)
- No data shared without your consent
- You can export or delete anytime
- See [docs/SECURITY.md](../docs/SECURITY.md) for details

**Q: Can I make my profile private?**

A: Yes. You can:
- Share only with specific employers
- Set up a private profile with password protection
- Create a public summary while keeping details private
- Control visibility of each experience

**Q: What if I change my mind? Can I update my profile?**

A: Yes, anytime:
- Edit any experience
- Adjust persona definitions
- Change visibility settings
- Update job search criteria
- All changes take effect immediately

**Q: Can I have multiple profiles?**

A: Yes. You might want:
- One for tech roles
- One for leadership roles
- One for creative work
- One for teaching/mentoring

Each profile is independent.

### Hunter Protocol Questions

**Q: How does the Hunter find jobs?**

A: The Hunter searches:
- LinkedIn Jobs
- Angel List
- RemoteOk
- Company career pages
- Custom job feeds
- (More sources coming)

It filters using your criteria and analyzes each match.

**Q: Can I modify the AI's analysis?**

A: Yes. You can:

### Persona Questions

**Q: Can I have more than 5 personas?**

A: Yes. You can create as many personas as are authentic to you. We recommend 2-5, but some people have more.

**Q: How do I avoid personas feeling like lies?**

A: Personas ARE you, just with different emphasis. Test this:
- Is a persona something you've genuinely done?
- Have you succeeded in that context?
- Would people who know you recognize it as authentically you?

If yes to all three, it's a persona, not a lie.

**Q: How do I know which persona to use for a job?**

A: The system recommends based on job description analysis. But you can also:
- Ask mentors which persona resonates
- Try different personas and see which feels right
- Mix personas for complex roles
