## DigitalOcean Hatch Program

**Application URL**: [digitalocean.com/hatch](https://www.digitalocean.com/hatch)
**Credits**: $1,000+ infrastructure credits
**Requirements**: Open source project with GitHub presence

### Application Template

**Project Name**: in-midst-my-life

**Project URL**: https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in

**Description** (1-2 paragraphs):
```
in-midst-my-life is an open-source "Identity Operating System" that transforms static resumes
into dynamic, verifiable professional identity profiles. Using a blockchain-inspired ledger
architecture, users can present context-specific views of their career through functional
"masks" (Analyst, Architect, Narrator, etc.) while maintaining identity invariants.

The system features autonomous job search via the Hunter Protocol, W3C Verifiable Credentials
integration, and a theatrical metaphor that treats professional evolution as temporal "epochs"
on different "stages." It's built with Next.js, Fastify, PostgreSQL, and Redis, with
comprehensive test coverage and hexagonal architecture.
```

**What would you use the credits for?**
```
- Kubernetes cluster for hosting the multi-service architecture (web, API, orchestrator)
- Managed PostgreSQL database for production data
- Managed Redis for caching and job queue
- Object storage for user-generated content (resumes, exports)
- Load balancer for production traffic
```

**Project Impact**:
```
- Democratizes professional identity presentation beyond rigid resume formats
- Open-source alternative to expensive career management tools
- Enables verifiable credentials for employment claims
- Autonomous job search to level the playing field for job seekers
```
