# COVENANT: In–Midst–My–Life

**A Binding Document on Complete Human Representation, Masked Identity, and Inverted Evaluation**

---

## PREAMBLE

This covenant articulates the principles, architecture, and operational philosophy of the in–midst–my–life system—a complete inversion of how human capability is recognized, represented, and evaluated.

We acknowledge that the traditional hiring system is fundamentally broken. It reduces complete humans to single dimensions, asks the impossible of fresh graduates, treats breadth as a red flag, and destroys dignity through 2000-application loops that yield nothing.

We do not reform this system. We replace it.

This document is both **philosophical declaration** and **operational blueprint**. It binds us to:
- Recognizing complete humans across all dimensions
- Valuing authentic multi-faceted identity
- Inverting asymmetric power through transparent mutual evaluation
- Building systems that respect time, dignity, and capability

---

## I. THE ORIGINAL VISION RESTATED

From the opening imagination:

> "Imagine: providing potential partners, employers, any interested party with a link to this interface. The interviewer becomes the interviewee. We are asking them questions. And the performance they seek from the potential candidate (me) enters from the sides of the stage."

**This is the covenant's core**: An interface where power is balanced, truth is visible, and both parties evaluate each other transparently.

The system we build answers this vision through three integrated frameworks:

1. **Curriculum Vitae Multiplex** — One master truth, many honest views
2. **Personae and Tabula Personarum** — Explicit acknowledgment of masked identity
3. **Hunter Protocol + Inverted Interview** — Autonomous job evaluation and mutual assessment

---

## II. THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

### The Documented Failure

```
2024 (Actual Experience):
Applied to: 2000 jobs
Hired: Agencies to apply for you
Created: 100s of different resumes
Received: 0 legitimate interviews
Result: Rage, burnout, psychological destruction
Decision: Exit the system entirely
```

### The Structural Dysfunction

The traditional hiring system is built on **systematic reduction**:

```
Human Complexity              →    System Capacity
Complete person               →    One-dimensional filter
Multiple capabilities         →    Single job title
Breadth of experience        →    "Red flag: unfocused"
Authentic identity           →    "Pick a persona and stick to it"
Lived wisdom across domains  →    "Not relevant to this field"
Real growth and recovery     →    "Hidden from resume"
```

This system doesn't fail because it's poorly designed. **It fails because it's designed to manage simplified units, not humans.**

A human who has:
- Raised children (systems thinking, patience, long-term planning)
- Created art (perception, composition, aesthetics)
- Recovered from addiction (pattern recognition, discipline, humility)
- Written code (problem-solving, architecture, iteration)
- Taught others (communication, adaptability, clarity)

Is **not less qualified**. The system is **incapable of recognizing complete qualification**.

### The Trap

The system says: "You need experience in this field to work in this field."
The person says: "How do I get that experience?"
The system says: "That's not our problem."

This trap is not accidental. It serves the system: perpetual exclusion, perpetual justification for exclusion.

**We do not try to fix this trap. We build a new system.**

---

## III. THE THREE-FOLD STRUCTURE OF COMPLETE HUMANITY

Any complete human embodies:

### [A] MASKS WE ASSUME (Personae)

Different authentic facets of the same person. Examples:

- **Persona Sapiens** — Scholar, analyst, researcher, truth-seeker
- **Persona Mechanica** — Systems thinker, builder, architect, infrastructure
- **Persona Fabulator** — Storyteller, artist, mythmaker, narrative designer
- **Persona Synthesist** — Connector, mediator, translator between worlds
- **Persona Errans** — Wanderer, experimenter, boundary-pusher, trickster
- **Persona Soror/Frater** — Parent, caregiver, teacher, nurturer

Each mask is:
- Authentic (not performed; genuinely you in that context)
- Specific (distinct mode of operation and perception)
- Complementary (not contradictory; all expressions of one person)
- Context-responsive (emerges where it matters)

### [B] PLACES WE FORM (Scaenae)

Different stages where masks operate. Examples:

- **Scaena Academica** — Classrooms, conferences, journals, scholarship
- **Scaena Technica** — Code repositories, infrastructure, systems, development
- **Scaena Artistica** — Galleries, festivals, performances, publications
- **Scaena Civica** — Community, public projects, institutions, service
- **Scaena Domestica** — Home, family, intimate relationships, private work
- **Scaena Occulta** — Pseudonymous spaces, underground experiments, boundary work

Each stage:
- Has its own audience and expectations
- Calls forth different masks
- Creates conditions for authentic performance
- Generates evidence of capability

### [C] THINGS WE DO (Opera)

The actual outputs, accomplishments, and evidence across all dimensions:

- Systems designed and shipped
- Code written and maintained
- Children raised
- Art created
- Recovery maintained daily
- Teams built and mentored
- Problems solved
- Relationships sustained
- Knowledge documented
- Boundaries pushed

**The unity is this**: All [a], [b], and [c] together form ONE complete human. To recognize human capability, you must see across all three dimensions simultaneously.

---

## IV. THE SYSTEM'S FATAL BLINDNESS

The traditional hiring system sees:

```
[A] Personae     → Collapsed to one "professional identity"
[B] Scaenae      → Recognized only if labeled "job-related"
[C] Opera        → Only outputs in current domain count
```

Result: **99% of human capability is invisible.**

What is lost:

- Mother's project management → "Parental gap on resume"
- Artist's perception → "Not relevant to engineering"
- Person in recovery's discipline → "Hidden from employers"
- Teacher's communication → "Not a sales job"
- Bartender's psychology → "Minimum wage, no skills"

The system doesn't just miss these. **It actively punishes you for having them.**

---

## V. THE COVENANT'S SOLUTION: CURRICULUM VITAE MULTIPLEX

We replace the broken system with:

### The Master Document

**Curriculum Vitae Multiplex** — "The complete running of one life"

One file. One truth. All your work, all your roles, all your growth documented once.

Each entry is tagged with:
```
Personae: Which mask(s) this belongs to
Aetas: Which life-stage (formative, consolidation, hybridization, transformation)
Scaenae: Which stage(s) (academic, technical, artistic, civic, domestic, hidden)
```

### The Filtered Views

**Resumés personarum** — Multiple honest views, all from the same source

Instead of writing 100 different resumes, you filter the master document:

```
"Show me Persona Mechanica"
→ Returns resume of systems thinking, building, architecture

"Show me Persona Fabulator in Aetas Multiplex through Scaena Artistica"
→ Returns narrative/story work across the hybrid period in artistic contexts

"Show me everything on Scaena Academica"
→ Returns teaching, research, scholarly output across all personae
```

Each filtered resumé is:
- **Honest** (selected from the same source, not rewritten)
- **Complete** (shows full depth of relevant experience)
- **Contextual** (shaped by what matters for this mask/stage/scene)
- **Transparent** (reader knows this is Persona X, aetas Y, scaena Z)

### The Index

**Tabula Personarum** — The rogue's gallery

A reference document listing all your masks with:
- Nomen (name)
- Everyday name (what you call it)
- Role vector (what it does)
- Tone register (how it speaks)
- Visibility scope (where it operates)
- Motto (Latin epigraph capturing its essence)

---

## VI. ARCHITECTURE: ONE SOURCE, MANY VALID VIEWS

### The File Structure

```
$DEV_HOME/
├── curriculum_vitae_multiplex.md         (ONE MASTER TRUTH)
├── tabula_personarum.csv                 (MASK INDEX)
└── personae/
    ├── persona_sapiens_resume.md         (Generated from master)
    ├── persona_mechanica_resume.md       (Generated from master)
    ├── persona_fabulator_resume.md       (Generated from master)
    └── persona_errans_resume.md          (Generated from master)
```

### The Encoding Rule

Write once. Tag completely. Filter as needed.

Example entry:

```markdown
### [2021–2023] Visiting Lecturer in Hybrid Narrative Systems
Department of X, University Y

Designed and taught experimental courses connecting mythic structures,
interactive fiction, and code-driven narrative engines. Supervised student
projects in multimodal storytelling. Authored papers on narrative as system.

Tags: personae=[Sapiens, Fabulator]; aetas=Multiplex; 
scaenae=[Academica, Artistica]; domains=[teaching, research, narrative]
```

This one entry appears in:
- **Persona Sapiens resume** (teaching + research)
- **Persona Fabulator resume** (narrative + system)
- **Scaena Academica dossier** (all academic work)
- **Scaena Artistica dossier** (all artistic work)
- **Aetas Multiplex timeline** (hybrid period work)

You write it once. It flows into every relevant context.

### The Filtering Logic

```
Mask-specific resumé:
  Show all entries tagged with this Persona
  Organize by Aetas (temporal arc)
  Within each Aetas, group by Scaena
  
Stage-specific dossier:
  Show all entries tagged with this Scaena
  Group by Persona (different facets of one place)
  
Time-specific archive:
  Show all entries from this Aetas
  Group by Persona (what was active then)
```

No single view is "the real you." **All views are real.** They're just different facets of the same complete human.

---

## VII. THE HUNTER PROTOCOL: AUTONOMOUS INTELLIGENT FILTERING

The Hunter Protocol operates on your behalf:

### The Problem It Solves

```
Without Hunter:
  Apply to 2000 jobs
  Hope something matches
  Get destroyed

With Hunter:
  System analyzes 2000 opportunities
  Filters to 20 genuine matches
  Evaluates each one thoroughly
  You only consider the real fits
```

### The Core Operations

**Find Jobs** (intelligent search)
- Search job boards by keywords + location
- Filter by skill requirements
- Score against your profile

**Analyze Gap** (honest assessment)
- Extract job requirements
- Compare against your actual capabilities
- Identify missing pieces
- Rate sustainability

**Tailor Resume** (show the right facet)
- Match job needs to your personae
- Select optimal mask for this role
- Highlight relevant experiences
- Demonstrate fit authentically

**Write Cover Letter** (explain the match)
- Personalize to organization
- Connect your capability to their needs
- Show authentic interest
- Make the case for mutual fit

### What Changes

```
OLD: Apply broadly, hope for interviews, get zero
NEW: Apply selectively, know the fit in advance, get real conversations
```

---

## VIII. THE INVERTED INTERVIEW: MUTUAL TRANSPARENT EVALUATION

The Inverted Interview inverts power through radical honesty.

### How It Works

**They visit your link.**

They enter their name, organization, job title.

**They answer YOUR questions:**

- "Tell me about a time you made a decision that prioritized people over metrics."
- "What does psychological safety actually look like in your org?"
- "How many people from this role have been promoted? Where?"
- "Tell me about a hire that looked perfect on paper but was terrible."
- "What would make someone miserable in this role?"

**While they answer, job requirements appear.**

(From their side: skills, salary, growth trajectory, KPIs)

**The system analyzes in real-time.**

Compatibility scores calculated across:
- Skill match
- Values alignment
- Growth fit
- Sustainability
- Compensation fairness

**Both parties get results:**

They see: "You're 72% compatible with this candidate."
You see: "This is 68% opportunity for you. Green flags: X. Red flags: Y."

### Why This Matters

The questions force honesty:

```
What they wrote:           What they revealed:
"Work-life balance"    →   "We had 3 burnouts last year"
"Mission-driven"       →   "Our founder is obsessed"
"Growth available"     →   "Nobody's promoted in 18 months"
"Hire for culture fit" →   "We tried that once, it failed"
"Team collaboration"   →   "People work in silos mostly"
```

**The gap between written and spoken is where the truth lives.**

When that gap is visible, bad matches become obvious before anyone wastes time.

---

## IX. THE PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND: THEATRUM MUNDI

We operate from an explicit theatrical frame:

```
Theatrum mundi: "The world is a stage."
Everyone plays roles. This is not deception. This is humanity.

Dramatis personae: "The persons of the drama."
You have multiple authentic roles. All are you.

In medias res: "In the middle of things."
Each resumé can start mid-story because the full story is available.

Persona: "Mask."
Originally the actor's physical mask. Now: the role, the voice, the mode.
Wearing many masks is not dishonesty. It's complete humanity.

Finis coronat opus: "The end crowns the work."
Your full CV (curriculum vitae multiplex) shows the complete arc.

Ars est celare artem: "The art is to conceal art."
OR, inverted: "The power is to REVEAL art."
We make explicit what was hidden.
```

This frame means:

**You are not dishonest for having multiple masks.**
You are honest about having them.

**You are not reduced to one persona.**
You present the relevant one, transparently.

**You are not hiding depth under a resume.**
Your depth is available in the full curriculum vitae multiplex.

**Organizations either see all of you or none of you.**
And they choose consciously.

---

## X. THE OPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

### How This Changes Everything

**Before (The Broken System):**
```
You apply broadly
Resume gets filtered by algorithms
Maybe a human glances at it for 6 seconds
They see mismatch (their criteria, your framing)
You get rejected
You never know why
You apply again, tweaking
Repeat 2000 times
No interviews
Despair

Why it fails:
- Criteria are vague
- "Pairings don't add up" (hidden expectations)
- You're performing reduction (lying about yourself)
- System can't see real capability
- Power is completely asymmetric
```

**After (The New System):**
```
Hunter Protocol evaluates 2000 opportunities
Filters to 20 genuine matches (skill + values + growth + sustainability + compensation)
For each real fit:
  - You see compatibility scores (data, not hope)
  - You see green/red flags (clarity, not mystery)
  - You know if it's worth your time

For organizations that pass:
  - Inverted Interview forces them to articulate what they actually need
  - You see their real culture, not their marketing copy
  - Both parties evaluate fit before investing time

Result:
- Quality over quantity (20 applications instead of 2000)
- Honesty over performance (show real masks, not false reductions)
- Dignity preserved (you're evaluating, not begging)
- Better matches (both parties are choosing consciously)

Why it works:
- Criteria are revealed through questions
- "Pairings" are made explicit and testable
- You're presenting your real selves (honest)
- System can see complete capability
- Power is balanced through transparency
```

### Core Commitments

This covenant commits us to:

**1. One Master Truth**
- Write once, in curriculum vitae multiplex
- Never maintain multiple separate narratives
- Everything is tagged completely
- All views are generated from the same source

**2. Transparent Personas**
- Acknowledge that you have multiple masks
- Don't hide this. Celebrate it.
- Make explicit in all documents that this is a filtered view
- Use Latin theatrical language to make the system self-aware

**3. Intelligent Filtering**
- Let the system select the relevant mask
- Don't pretend to be one-dimensional
- Show the depth that matters for this context
- Remain honest (this is Persona X, not pretending to be something else)

**4. Mutual Evaluation**
- Never apply to opportunities without data
- Let organizations prove themselves to you
- Evaluate them as hard as they evaluate you
- Walk away from bad fits confidently

**5. Respect for Time**
- Your time is valuable
- Don't waste 2000 applications on broken matching
- Apply only to real fits
- Invest in quality over quantity

**6. Dignity Preserved**
- You are not reduced to a resume
- Your complete self is available
- You evaluate from a position of strength
- You choose, not hope

---

## XI. IMPLEMENTATION: FROM PHILOSOPHY TO CODE

### Immediate: Build the Documents

**Step 1: Curriculum Vitae Multiplex**

Create `$DEV_HOME/curriculum_vitae_multiplex.md`

Structure:
```
# Curriculum Vitae Multiplex

Praefatio (statement that this is one life, many views)

Aetas Primaria – [Life stage 1]
[Entries tagged with personae, scaenae]

Aetas Media – [Life stage 2]
[Entries tagged with personae, scaenae]

Aetas Multiplex – [Life stage 3]
[Entries tagged with personae, scaenae]

[Additional sections: Opera Selecta, Educatio, etc.]
```

**Step 2: Tabula Personarum**

Create `$DEV_HOME/tabula_personarum.csv`

Columns: mask_id, nomen_personae, everyday_name, role_vector, tone_register, visibility_scope, motto_latin

Example rows:
```
01,Persona Sapiens,Scholar,"research, teaching, writing","precise, analytical","academia, institutions","Finis coronat opus"
02,Persona Mechanica,Builder,"code, systems, architecture","rigorous, systemic","tech, infrastructure","Ars est celare artem"
03,Persona Fabulator,Storyteller,"narrative, myth, art","experimental, evocative","art, festivals","Theatrum mundi"
04,Persona Errans,Wanderer,"hybrid, experimental, boundary","playful, transgressive","underground, special projects","In medias res"
```

**Step 3: Generate Personae Resumés**

From the master file, filter by persona:

```
Title: Resumé: Persona Sapiens
Subheading: dramatis persona: scholar
Epigraph: "Finis coronat opus"

Intentio: [One sentence on this persona's scope]

Qualificatio: [Summary from entries tagged Sapiens]

Experientia Selecta: [Roles tagged Sapiens, reverse chronological]

Opera Selecta: [Works tagged Sapiens]

[Rest of standard resumé sections]
```

### Medium: Integrate with Hunter Protocol

The Hunter Protocol's **tailor_resume()** function selects the right mask:

```typescript
tailorResume(job: JobPosting, profile: Profile): {
  selectedMask: Mask,
  selectedExperiences: Experience[],
  resumeMarkdown: string
}
```

Instead of returning a rewritten resume, it:
1. Analyzes job requirements
2. Matches to most resonant persona
3. Filters curriculum_vitae_multiplex by that persona
4. Returns the official generated resumé

Result: Job gets the authentic filtered view, not a fake rewrite.

### Long Term: UI Integration

The web interface allows:
- Browse curriculum_vitae_multiplex
- Toggle masks to see different resumés
- See tabula_personarum (rogue's gallery)
- View full arc by life-stage
- Filter by venue/stage

Employers/interviewers can:
- Request specific mask view
- See which aetas period applies
- Understand that this is one complete human with multiple facets
- Make informed decisions

## XIV. FINIS CORONAT OPUS

The end crowns the work.

What you have built through pain, through the 2000 applications, through exiting the broken game and spending a year becoming a fan of yourself again, is now complete:

**A system that says:**

> "You are not a resume. You are not a job title. You are a complete human with multiple authentic masks, operating across different stages in your life, accumulating wisdom and capability across all domains.
>
> We recognize all of you. We don't ask you to reduce yourself. We filter what's relevant while acknowledging the full depth is available.
>
> Organizations either see your complete humanity or none of it. And if they see it, they must evaluate themselves equally. Power is balanced. Truth is transparent.
>
> You are not unemployable. The system was incapable of seeing you. Now it can.
>
> You apply not to 2000 opportunities hoping for a callback. You apply to 20 you've analyzed, to organizations that have proved themselves to you, where you see genuine fit.
>
> Your time is valuable. Your dignity is preserved. Your capability is visible.
>
> Theatrum mundi. You are the actor. You have many masks. All are you. All are real."

This is the covenant.

This is binding.
