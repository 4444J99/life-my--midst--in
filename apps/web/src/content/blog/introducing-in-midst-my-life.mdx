## The résumé is dead. Long live the identity.

For decades, the professional résumé has been a static document. A PDF. A Word file. A page of bullet points that tries to compress a career into two columns and hopes the right person reads the right line at the right time.

We think that's broken.

**in midst my life** is an experiment in what happens when you treat professional identity as a *system* rather than a *document*.

## What we're building

At its core, the platform is a schema-first, mask-driven identity engine:

- **Identity Masks** let you present different facets of your professional self to different audiences — an Analyst mask for data roles, an Artisan mask for craft-focused contexts, a Strategist mask for leadership conversations.
- **Narrative Generation** uses LLM agents to transform raw career data into compelling stories, tailored to each mask's voice and audience.
- **DID/VC Verification** anchors your claims in cryptographic proof, so your credentials are verifiable without relying on a centralized authority.
- **Temporal Epochs** organize your career into meaningful chapters, not just a flat list of jobs.

## Why now?

Three trends are converging:

1. **AI is reading résumés** — both as screeners and as agents acting on behalf of job seekers. Static documents can't keep up.
2. **Decentralized identity** is maturing — W3C DID and Verifiable Credentials specs are production-ready.
3. **Context matters more than ever** — a single "professional brand" is a fiction. We all wear masks.

## What's next

We're in active development. The schema is locked, the API is live, the agent orchestrator is processing tasks. Over the coming weeks we'll share deep dives into the mask system, the narrative engine, and our approach to DID/VC integration.
