## The trust problem

When you claim "5 years of React experience" on your résumé, who verifies that? Today, the answer is: *the hiring manager calls your references, maybe*. That's a trust model built on phone calls and gut feelings.

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) flip this. Instead of trusting the *claim*, you verify the *proof*.

## Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

A DID is a globally unique identifier that you control. Unlike a LinkedIn URL or email address, no company can deactivate your DID or change its meaning.

A DID looks like this:

```
did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK
```

The key parts:
- `did` — it's a DID
- `key` — the DID method (how to resolve it)
- `z6Mkha...` — the method-specific identifier (in this case, a public key)

Our system currently supports `did:key` (self-sovereign, no network needed) and we're adding `did:web` (domain-anchored, HTTP-resolvable) next.

## Verifiable Credentials

A VC is a signed claim about a subject. For example:

> "Alice has a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from MIT, graduated 2020."

This claim is:
1. **Issued** by MIT (the issuer signs it with their DID)
2. **Held** by Alice (she stores it in her identity wallet)
3. **Verified** by anyone (they check the issuer's signature against MIT's public DID)

No intermediary needed. No API call to MIT's servers. The math checks out or it doesn't.

## How we use DID/VC

In our system, every profile can:

1. **Generate a DID** — create a `did:key` pair with one click
2. **Issue self-attested VCs** — sign claims about your own experience
3. **Import third-party VCs** — attach credentials issued by employers, schools, or certification bodies
4. **Export VC bundles** — share a verifiable credential package via the API

The `/profiles/:id/export/vc` endpoint returns a W3C-compliant Verifiable Presentation that any standards-compliant verifier can validate.

## What's next

We're working on `did:web` support, which anchors your DID to a domain you control. This means verifiers can resolve your identity by fetching `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/did.json` — combining the self-sovereignty of DIDs with the trust signals of domain ownership.
