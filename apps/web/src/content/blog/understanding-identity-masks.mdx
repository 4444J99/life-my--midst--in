## The mask metaphor

In classical theater, a *persona* was literally a mask — an amplifier that let actors project different voices to different parts of the audience. We borrow that metaphor deliberately.

An Identity Mask in our system is not deception. It's *contextual emphasis*. The same professional — with the same skills, experiences, and credentials — might present very differently to:

- A venture capital partner evaluating leadership acumen
- A hiring manager screening for technical depth
- A potential collaborator looking for creative range

## How masks work

Each mask defines three things:

1. **Voice** — the rhetorical mode (analytical, narrative, provocative, conciliatory)
2. **Focus Tags** — which skills, projects, and experiences to foreground
3. **Filtering Rules** — what to include, exclude, or de-emphasize

When you generate a narrative through a mask, the Narrator agent uses these parameters to shape the output. The underlying data doesn't change — only its presentation.

## The 15+ built-in masks

Our system ships with a rich set of default masks:

- **Analyst** — precise, metrics-aware, minimal flourish
- **Strategist** — directional, tradeoff framing, prioritization language
- **Artisan** — craft-focused, tactile detail, quality signals
- **Executor** — concise, action/result oriented, operational clarity
- **Provoker** — incisive, contrarian, tension-forward
- **Mediator** — empathetic, alignment language, stakeholder emphasis
- **Synthesist** — connects disparate ideas, systems-level perspective

And more. Each mask has a dedicated system prompt that guides the LLM narrative engine.

## Custom masks

Beyond the defaults, you can define your own masks with custom voice parameters, focus tags, and filtering rules. This is particularly powerful for niche audiences — a conference talk proposal needs a very different voice than a grant application.

## What's next

In the next post, we'll dive into the **DID/VC verification layer** — how we're making professional credentials cryptographically verifiable without centralized authorities.
